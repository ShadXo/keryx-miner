# Keryx Miner

A high-performance GPU miner for **Keryx**.

Proof of work is **PoM — Proof of Model**: every nonce walks the weights of the AI model your GPU holds, so mining requires genuine possession of that model, and the tier you prove scales your share of the block reward. The same resident model answers on-chain inference requests (**OPoI** — Optimistic Proof of Inference).

## Build from Source

### Requirements

- Rust + Cargo ([rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/))
- `protoc` (`protobuf-compiler`)
- `cmake` and `git` (the inference engine builds llama.cpp from source)
- **CUDA 12.2 toolkit** — `nvcc` is mandatory, there is no CUDA-less build: `build.rs` compiles the PoM mining kernel into a PTX ladder on every build, and the miner cannot mine without it
- **GCC ≤ 12** (Ubuntu 22.04 / GCC 11 works out of the box); on newer hosts use Option B

CUDA **12.2** specifically: nvcc 12.2 emits code that runs on **NVIDIA driver ≥ 535**, whereas newer toolkits raise that floor (HiveOS commonly ships 535.x). The two prebuilt PoM fatbins are committed to the repo and are simply embedded by the build — you never need to regenerate them unless you change `cuda/pom_mine.cu`, in which case see [cuda/README.md](cuda/README.md).

### Option A — CUDA 12.2 toolkit installed on host (recommended)

Install the toolkit side-by-side (runfile, toolkit-only, no driver), then point the build at it:

```bash
# one-time: install the CUDA 12.2 toolkit to ~/cuda-12.2 (no driver, no root needed)
wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/12.2.2/local_installers/cuda_12.2.2_535.104.05_linux.run
bash cuda_12.2.2_535.104.05_linux.run --silent --toolkit --toolkitpath="$HOME/cuda-12.2" --override

git clone https://github.com/Keryx-Labs/keryx-miner.git
cd keryx-miner
CUDA_ROOT="$HOME/cuda-12.2" CUDA_PATH="$HOME/cuda-12.2" \
  PATH="$HOME/cuda-12.2/bin:$PATH" \
  cargo build --release
```

Produces `target/release/keryx-miner` plus `libkeryx-llama.so` next to it. **Both are needed** — the inference engine is loaded from that shared object at runtime, so keep them together when you move the binary.

The first build clones and compiles llama.cpp (cached under `target/`, near no-op on rebuilds). Its GPU architectures come from `KERYX_LLAMA_ARCHS`, default `75-real;80-real;86-real;89-real;89-virtual`. Official releases use a wider set:

```bash
KERYX_LLAMA_ARCHS="70;75;80;86;89;90" cargo build --release
```

`KERYX_LLAMA_SKIP=1` skips that step entirely, but a prebuilt `libkeryx-llama.so` must then sit next to the binary or no tier can be mined.

### Option B — CUDA 13.x or incompatible gcc on host (build via container)

If your system has CUDA 13.x or gcc 13+ (e.g. Fedora 40+, Ubuntu 25+), build inside a CUDA 12.2 container. The binary runs on the host via driver forward-compatibility.

Requires: [Podman](https://podman.io/) (rootless) or Docker, NVIDIA driver ≥ 535.

```bash
cd keryx-miner
podman run --rm --security-opt label=disable \
  -v "$PWD":/src -w /src \
  -e CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/src/target-cuda \
  docker.io/nvidia/cuda:12.2.2-devel-ubuntu22.04 \
  bash -c '
    apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y -qq \
      curl build-essential cmake git pkg-config libssl-dev ca-certificates protobuf-compiler >/dev/null 2>&1
    curl --proto "=https" --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y --profile minimal >/dev/null 2>&1
    . "$HOME/.cargo/env"
    export CUDA_PATH=/usr/local/cuda PROTOC=/usr/bin/protoc
    export KERYX_LLAMA_ARCHS="70;75;80;86;89;90"
    cargo build --release'
```

Binary and `libkeryx-llama.so`: `target-cuda/release/`.

> This path has **not been re-tested since the llama.cpp migration**. `cmake`, `git` and an explicit `KERYX_LLAMA_ARCHS` were added because the container has no GPU to auto-detect; if it fails, Option A on a distro with GCC ≤ 12 is the supported route.

> **Runtime dependencies.** Mining needs only `libcuda.so.1` (the driver). Inference additionally `dlopen`s `libcublas.so.12` and `libcurand.so.10`, so the host must have the matching CUDA 12.2 runtime libs (`libcublas-12-2`, `libcurand-12-2`). On HiveOS the miner installs and registers them automatically on first run; on other hosts install them via your package manager or the CUDA 12.2 toolkit.

> **Blackwell (RTX 50xx).** Nothing to configure: the committed nextgen fatbin carries native `sm_89`/`sm_90`/`sm_100`/`sm_120` SASS, so a 50-series card runs native code with no JIT. This matters — a Blackwell card falling back to JIT from PTX emitted by CUDA 12.2 loses roughly half its hashrate (measured on RTX 5090 and 5080). If you ever rebuild the fatbins yourself, the nextgen one requires CUDA ≥ 12.8; see [cuda/README.md](cuda/README.md).

## Usage

```bash
./keryx-miner --mining-address keryx:YOUR_ADDRESS
```

Inference is not optional. A miner that holds no model cannot prove possession and cannot mine — there is no PoW-only mode.

### Model tiers

One tier, one model. The tier you prove through PoM (Proof of Model) scales your share of the block reward: the higher the tier, the larger the miner cut.

With no flag, each GPU mines the **highest tier its VRAM holds**. The flags are a *ceiling*, not a selection — use one to hold a card below its maximum (smaller download, less VRAM pressure, lower power draw).

This is the H6 lineup, live from mainnet DAA 76,316,623. The pre-H6 models are retired: below that gate no tier has a consensus-valid model, so a miner started early idles until the gate rather than mining something the node would reject.

| Flag | Model | Quant | Min VRAM |
|------|-------|-------|----------|
| `--very-light` | Qwen3.5-9B-abliterated | Q5_K_M | 8 GB+ |
| `--light` | GLM-4-9B-0414 | Q6_K | 12 GB+ |
| *(none, default)* | Gemma-4-12B-abliterated | Q6_K | 16 GB+ |
| `--high` | Qwen3.6-27B | Q4_K_M | 24 GB+ |
| `--very-high` | Kimi-Linear-48B | Q4_K_M | 32 GB+ |

Only the models for eras the chain can still reach are downloaded, so with H6 as the only live era that is **one model per tier**. A card mining more than one tier (across a multi-GPU rig) still needs each of those tiers' models on disk.

Tiers are **not cumulative**: each one serves exactly one model, and a card that cannot hold the model you asked for falls back to a tier it can actually serve.

On a multi-GPU rig the tier is assigned per card from its VRAM, so a mixed rig runs several tiers side by side. `--force-model` overrides that per GPU, in CUDA driver order — including past the VRAM floor, which is why forcing a tier your card cannot hold only penalises you (OOM, or a partial-possession slowdown):

```bash
./keryx-miner --mining-address keryx:YOUR_ADDRESS --force-model light,very-high
```

The model is loaded **on demand** when a request arrives and cached between requests. Mining pauses on that GPU during inference, then resumes automatically.

### Faster proof build (optional)

`--resident-tree` holds the full Merkle tree in RAM, so building a block's proof is a lookup instead of an on-the-fly recompute. It needs roughly **2× the model size in system RAM** (not VRAM) — about 13 GB for the smallest tier, ~40 GB for the largest. If the machine doesn't have the RAM, the miner logs a warning and keeps the default disk-backed path, so enabling it is always safe.

```bash
./keryx-miner --mining-address keryx:YOUR_ADDRESS --resident-tree
```

### Getting the models

Nothing to download by hand: on first run the miner fetches the model for your tier over IPFS and caches it. It looks for the weights at:

```
<directory of the keryx-miner executable>/models/<Model-Name>/model.gguf
```

Point it somewhere else with `--models-dir /path/to/models` (or the `KERYX_MODELS_DIR` environment variable). The path you give is the **root** — the miner still appends `<Model-Name>/model.gguf` under it.

If IPFS is slow or blocked on your network, download the archive and unzip it into that models folder. Keep the folder name exactly as listed below, and use `--ipfs-url` if you would rather point at a different gateway.

A correct manual install looks like this — the miner writes the `.ok` marker itself once it has validated the file, so there is no need to create it:

```
keryx-miner
models/
└── Qwen3.6-27B/
    └── model.gguf
```

If the miner still downloads a model although the folder is there, check your tier flag before anything else: the flag decides **which** model is requested, `--models-dir` only says **where** to look.

### Escrow state durability

Escrow keys and claim state are written through a same-directory temporary file, synced, and atomically installed. An unreadable key or malformed state file stops escrow initialization without replacing the existing bytes. Recovery output uses the same atomic write path.

On HiveOS, the durable files live outside the replaceable miner package at `/hive/miners/custom/keryx-miner-state/escrow.key` and `/hive/miners/custom/keryx-miner-state/escrow_state.json`, with directory mode `0700` and file mode `0600`. Back up both files together before an upgrade or manual recovery. Never delete an invalid key to generate another one: restore the original backup because it controls existing rewards. See [`integrations/hiveos/HIVEOS_README.md`](integrations/hiveos/HIVEOS_README.md) for verified migration and rollback steps.

### All options

```bash
./keryx-miner --help
```

### Block celebration

Block celebration is excluded from default builds so its native audio dependency does not affect release portability. To include it, build with `--features block-celebration`, then pass `--block-celebration` when starting the miner. Both opt-ins are required; animation and sound start disabled otherwise.

When enabled in the terminal UI, it displays a short coin animation and plays a sound on the miner host after a locally mined block is accepted. Press `B` to toggle the animation and `M` to mute or enable the sound independently during the session. If the host has no audio device, mining continues without sound.
